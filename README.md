# 🛒 NextBuy

NextBuy is a static frontend **E-Commerce Single Page Application (SPA)** built to demonstrate modern frontend development skills. It showcases a responsive, intuitive, and well-structured UI for browsing and buying products like Phones, Laptops, SmartWatches, Gaming Consoles (PS5), and HeadPhones.

---

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of **NextBuy** is to:
- Showcase frontend architecture and design patterns
- Practice React with TypeScript, Redux
- Demonstrate knowledge of Redux for state management
- Build a modular SPA using modern web development tools
- Provide a future-ready structure for easy backend/API integration
- Practice input validation, form handling, and animated UI feedback

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Core library for building UI components  
- **TypeScript** – Strong typing and tooling support  
- **JavaScript** – Scripting and logic implementation  
- **React-Redux** – State management  
- **React-Router-Dom** – SPA routing and navigation  
- **HTML5** – Semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **Docker** – Containerization for deployment-ready builds
- **Mock Server (JSON Server)** – Backend simulation for API-like behavior 

---
## 🚀 Project Highlights

✅ **Input Validations**  
All forms and input fields are validated to ensure clean and consistent data. This includes address forms, product interactions, and login/register UI.

✅ **Redux for Simulated Features**  
- Add to Cart  
- Add to Wishlist  
- Add Address  

These features are **fully simulated using `React-Redux`** for now, and the architecture is designed to **seamlessly plug in real APIs** in the future.

✅ **Animated Payment Simulation**  
A smooth animation gives the user visual feedback of a payment-like experience, enhancing UX without backend logic.

✅ **API-Ready Architecture**  
Codebase is designed with separation of concerns (e.g., using `actions`, `reducers`, `slices`), making it easy to switch from simulated to real data sources when APIs are available.
